File size is: 282335 bytes (0.28 MB)
Time taken to transfer 282335 bytes: 0.145522 seconds

File size is: 10485760 bytes (10 MB)
Time taken to transfer 10485760 bytes: 5.048142 seconds

Trend that the time takes to transfer goes up with the size.
Reason is due to the read/write speed being constant while the load it has to complete raises,
so it takes longer to do more at the same transfer pace.

File Size: 104857600 bytes (100 MB)
Time taken to transfer 104857600 bytes: 22.100918 seconds

My answer: the bottleneck must be the buffer capacity because since the file is 
so large, it has to do many iterations of a small percentage of the file size.
